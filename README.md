# Dyspraxia Awareness

This project was created to compliment a piece of work that my partner worked on for her Occupational Therapy degree.

The goal was to simulate the effects overstimulation on a dyspraxic mind.

People were placed at a messy desk with a laptop that had a modified racing game installed on it. The desk was cluttered with a coffee cup, paperwork, info booklets, diagrams, stationary etc with an audio track of loud background chatter and a student distracting them with general conversation.

The racing game was a modified version of the Unity karting microgame that randomly flipped the left and right controls causing the kart to crash into the side walls of the course simulating how people with dyspraxia often confuse their left and right and struggle with visual spatial awareness.

Out of the 10 people that tried it, only 1 person completed the course with a few others making it near.
